# Vietnam Banknotes Classification - Using Machine Learning

## Project Motivation
The original idea from a kind guy wanted to make a banknotes recognition device to identify banknotes supporting the blind. The device will use an AI camera combined with a pre-trained machine learning model to recognize the banknotes.

## File Structure
- Banknotes_Classifier_Model.ipynb : This is the jupyter notebook file used to train the model. Using Transfer-Learning method from very good models from ImageNet competition
- Main.py : This is the python code file used to create the streamlit application for the project

## Project Process:
- Step 1: A lot of banknote images are collected to create a data library for the project, the banknotes are classified by value.


Step 2: The data is cleaned again and preprocessed to increase model diversity
Step 3: Build a model and use Transfer Learning to inherit previous machine learning models.
Step 4: Training Model
Step 5: Real Test with Hidden Test Set
